## Getting started

Install JavaScript dependencies from the repository root:

pnpm install
```

Run the web app and API together:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The web app is available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and
the API health endpoint is available at
[http://localhost:8080/healthz](http://localhost:8080/healthz).

Run either application independently:

```bash
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:api
```

The API's runtime variables and authentication endpoints are documented in
[`apps/api/README.md`](apps/api/README.md). The initial image limit is 2 MiB and
is configurable through `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`.
